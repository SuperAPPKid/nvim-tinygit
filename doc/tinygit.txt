FEATURES OVERVIEW                     *tinygit-nvim-tinygit-features-overview*

- **Smart-Commit**Open a popup to enter a commit message with syntax highlighting,
    commit preview, and overlength indicators. If there are no staged
    changed, stages all changes before doing so (`git add -A`). Optionally trigger
    a `git push` afterward.
- Quick commands for amend, stash, fixup, and squash commits.
- Search **issues & PRs**. Open the selected issue or PR in the browser.
- Open the **GitHub URL** of the current file or selection.
- **Search the file history** for a string ("git pickaxe"), show results in a diff
    with filetype syntax highlighting, correctly following file renamings.
- **Statusline Components:** `git blame` and branch state.
- Highlighting improvements for interactive **rebasing** when using nvim as sequence
    editor.

INSTALLATION                               *tinygit-nvim-tinygit-installation*

At least version 0.10 of nvim is required for this plugin.

Install the Treesitter parser for git filetypes: `TSInstall gitcommit
git_rebase`

>lua
    -- lazy.nvim
    {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-tinygit",
        ft = { "git_rebase", "gitcommit" }, -- so ftplugins are loaded
        dependencies = {
            "stevearc/dressing.nvim",
            "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", -- either telescope or fzf-lua
            -- "ibhagwan/fzf-lua",
            "rcarriga/nvim-notify", -- optional, but will lack some features without it
        },
    },
    
    -- packer
    use {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-tinygit",
        requires = {
            "stevearc/dressing.nvim",
            "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", -- either telescope or fzf-lua
            -- "ibhagwan/fzf-lua",
            "rcarriga/nvim-notify", -- optional, but will lack some features without it
        },

COMMANDS                                       *tinygit-nvim-tinygit-commands*


SMART-COMMIT ~

- Open a commit popup, alongside a preview of what is going to be committed. If
    there are no staged changes, stage all changes (`git add --all`) before the
    commit.
- Input field contents of aborted commits are briefly kept, if you just want to
    fix a detail.
- Optionally run `git push` if the repo is clean after committing.
- The title of the input field displays what actions are going to be performed.
    You can see at glance, whether all changes are going to be committed or whether
    there a `git push` is triggered afterward, so there are no surprises.
- Currently, only supports the commit subject line (no commit body).

>lua
    require("tinygit").smartCommit { pushIfClean = false } -- options default to `false`
<

**Example Workflow** Assuming these keybindings:

>lua
    vim.keymap.set("n", "ga", "<cmd>Gitsigns add_hunk<CR>") -- gitsigns.nvim
    vim.keymap.set("n", "gc", function() require("tinygit").smartCommit() end)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "gp", function() require("tinygit").push() end)
<

1. Stage some hunks (changes) via `ga`.
2. Use `gc` to enter a commit message.
3. Repeat 1 and 2.
4. When done, `gp` to push the commits.

Using `pushIfClean = true` allows you to combine staging, committing, and
pushing into a single step, when it is the last commit you intend to make.


AMEND ~

- `amendOnlyMsg` just opens the commit popup to change the last commit message,
    and does not stage any changes.
- `amendNoEdit` keeps the last commit message; if there are no staged changes,
    stages all changes (`git add --all`), like `smartCommit`.
- Optionally runs `git push --force-with-lease` afterward, if the branch has
    diverged (that is, the amended commit was already pushed).

>lua
    -- options default to `false`
    require("tinygit").amendOnlyMsg { forcePushIfDiverged = false }
    require("tinygit").amendNoEdit { forcePushIfDiverged = false }
<


FIXUP & SQUASH COMMITS ~

- `fixupCommit` lets you select a commit from the last X commits and runs `git   commit --fixup` on the selected commit.
- If there are no staged changes, stages all changes (`git add --all`), like
    `smartCommit`.
- Use `squashInstead = true` to squash instead of fixup (`git commit --squash`).
- `autoRebase = true` automatically runs rebase with `--autosquash` and
    `--autostash` afterward, confirming all fixups and squashes **without opening a rebase view**. (Note that this can potentially result in conflicts.)

>lua
    -- options show default values
    require("tinygit").fixupCommit { 
        selectFromLastXCommits = 15,
        squashInstead = false, 
        autoRebase = false,
    }
<


UNDO LAST COMMIT/AMEND ~

>lua
    require("tinygit").undoLastCommitOrAmend()
<

- Changes in the working directory are kept, but unstaged. Effectively, any
    `commit` (or `amend`) operation is undone.
- Note that any `push` operation done as a followup (such as `.smartCommit {   pushIfClean = false }`) are not undone.
- This command basically runs `git reset --mixed HEAD@{1}`.


GITHUB INTERACTION ~

- Search issues & PRs. (Requires `curl`.)

>lua
    -- state: all|closed|open (default: all)
    -- type: all|issue|pr (default: all)
    require("tinygit").issuesAndPrs { type = "all", state = "all" }
    
    -- alternative: if the word under the cursor is of the form `#123`,
    -- just open that issue/PR
    require("tinygit").openIssueUnderCursor()
<

- Open the current file at GitHub in the browser and copy the URL to the system clipboard.
- Normal mode: open the current file or repo.
- Visual mode: open the current selection.

>lua
    -- file|repo (default: file)
    require("tinygit").githubUrl("file")
<


PUSH & PR ~

- `push` can be combined with other actions, depending on the options.
- `createGitHubPr` opens a PR from the current branch browser.
    - This requires the repo to be a fork with sufficient information on the remote.
    - This does not require the `gh` cli, as it uses a GitHub web feature.

>lua
    -- options default to `false`
    require("tinygit").push {
        pullBefore = false,
        forceWithLease = false,
        createGitHubPr = false,
    }
    require("tinygit").createGitHubPr()
<


SEARCH FILE/FUNCTION HISTORY (“GIT PICKAXE”) ~

Search the git history. Select from the matching commits to open a popup with a
diff of the changes.

- Search the git **history of the current file for a term** (`git log -G`).
    - The search is case-insensitive and supports regex.
    - Correctly follows file renamings, display past file names in the commit
        selection.
- Explore the **history of a function in the current file** (`git log -L`).
    - The search is literal.
    - If the current buffer has an LSP with support for document symbols
        attached, you can select a function. (Otherwise, you are prompted to
        enter a function name.)
    - Note that `git` uses heuristics to determine the enclosing function of a
        change <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38153309>, so this is not
        100% perfect and has varying reliability across languages.

**Keymaps in the diff popup** - `<Tab>`/`<S-Tab>`cycle through the commits. -
`yh`yank the commit hash to the system clipboard. - `n`/`N` (file history): go
to the next/previous occurrence of the query.

>lua
    require("tinygit").searchFileHistory()
    require("tinygit").functionHistory()
<


STASH ~

>lua
    require("tinygit").stashPush()
    require("tinygit").stashPop()
<


STATUS LINE COMPONENTS           *tinygit-nvim-tinygit-status-line-components*


GIT BLAME ~

Shows the message and date (`git blame`) of the last commit that changed the
current _file_ (not line).

>lua
    require("tinygit.statusline").blame()
<


  [!TIP] Some status line plugins also allow you to put components into the
  tabline or winbar. If your status line is too crowded, you can add the
  blame-component to the one of those bars instead.
The component can be configured with the `statusline.blame` options in the
|tinygit-plugin-configuration|.


BRANCH STATE ~

Shows whether the local branch is ahead or behind of its remote counterpart.
(Note that this component does not run `git fetch` for performance reasons, so
the information may not be up-to-date with remote changes.)

>lua
    require("tinygit.statusline").branchState()
<


OTHER FEATURES                           *tinygit-nvim-tinygit-other-features*


IMPROVED HIGHLIGHTING OF INTERACTIVE REBASE ~

`tinygit` also comes with some highlighting improvements for interactive
rebasing (`git rebase -i`).


  [!NOTE] This requires `nvim` as your git editor (or sequence editor). You can
  do so by running `git config --global core.editor "nvim"`.
If you want to disable the modifications by `tinygit`, add this to your config:

>lua
    vim.g.tinygit_no_rebase_ftplugin = true
<


CONFIGURATION                             *tinygit-nvim-tinygit-configuration*

The `setup` call is optional. These are the default settings:

>lua
    local defaultConfig = {
        commitMsg = {
            -- Shows diffstats of the changes that are going to be committed.
            -- (requires nvim-notify)
            commitPreview = true,
    
            conventionalCommits = {
                enforce = false, -- disallow commit messages without a keyword
                -- stylua: ignore
                keywords = {
                    "fix", "feat", "chore", "docs", "refactor", "build", "test",
                    "perf", "style", "revert", "ci", "break", "improv",
                },
            },
    
            -- enable vim's builtin spellcheck for the commit message input field.
            -- (configured to ignore capitalization and correctly consider camelCase)
            spellcheck = false,
    
            -- if commit message references issue/PR, open it in the browser
            openReferencedIssue = false,
    
            -- how long to remember the state of the message input field when aborting
            keepAbortedMsgSecs = 300,
        },
        push = {
            preventPushingFixupOrSquashCommits = true,
            confirmationSound = true, -- currently macOS only, PRs welcome
        },
        issueIcons = {
            openIssue = "🟢",
            closedIssue = "🟣",
            openPR = "🟩",
            mergedPR = "🟪",
            closedPR = "🟥",
        },
        historySearch = {
            diffPopup = {
                width = 0.8, -- float, 0 to 1
                height = 0.8,
                border = "single",
            },
            -- if trying to call `git log` on a shallow repository, automatically
            -- unshallow the repo by running `git fetch --unshallow`
            autoUnshallowIfNeeded = false,
        },
        statusline = {
            blame = {
                -- Any of these authors and the component is not shown (useful for bots)
                ignoreAuthors = {},
    
                -- show component, but leave out names (useful for your own name)
                hideAuthorNames = {},
    
                maxMsgLen = 35,
                icon = "ﰖ ",
            },
    
            branchState = {
                icons = {
                    ahead = "󰶣",
                    behind = "󰶡",
                    diverge = "󰃻",
                },
            },
        },
    }
<

The appearance of the commit message input field and of the selectors is
configured via dressing.nvim <https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim>. To
enable normal mode in the input field, use:

>lua
    require("dressing").setup {
        input = { insert_only = false },
    }
<

The appearance of the commit preview is determined by nvim-notify
<https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify>. To change for example the width of
the preview, use:

>lua
    require("notify").setup {
        max_width = 60,
    }
<


COMPARISON TO EXISTING GIT PLUGINS*tinygit-nvim-tinygit-comparison-to-existing-git-plugins*

- `gitsigns.nvim`No feature overlap. `tinygit` rather complements `gitsigns`
    as the latter is used to stage changes (`:GitSigns stage_hunk`) quickly, and
    the former allows you to commit (and push) those changes quickly.
- `Neogit` / `Fugitive`These two probably cover every feature `tinygit` has,
    but with much more configuration options. The benefit of `tinygit` is that it
    is more lightweight and aims to streamline common actions by smartly combining
    operations. For instance, the smart-commit command combines staging,
    committing, and pushing.
- `diffview.nvim`No overlap, except for the command to search the file history.
    `tinygit`’s version of file history search should be easier to use and has a few
    more quality-of-life features, such as automatically jumping to occurrences of
    the search term. As opposed to `diffview`, the diff is not presented in a
    side-by-side-diff, but in a unified view.
